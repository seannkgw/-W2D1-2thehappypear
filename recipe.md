⋅⋅* Preheat the oven to 220 C.

⋅⋅* Roughly chop the fried veg. Chop the cauliflower into florets. Chop the sweet potato into bite size pieces. Peel and quarter the onion. Toss all the veg and garlic in the oil. On 3 separate baking trays, add the cauliflower to one, the sweet potato to the second and the mixed veg to the remaining tray. Toss each tray in ½ tsp of salt and roast for 30 minutes or until cooked through and the cauliflower is nicely charred. You can roast all the veg the day before and keep in the fridge until time to make your sauce.

⋅⋅* While the veg is roasting, weigh and toast your spices in a large non stick pan, over medium to low heat for 1-2 minutes, this helps to wake up the spices and helps them release their flavour. Leave aside.

⋅⋅* When the veg is cooked, remove from the oven, leave aside the roasted cauliflower and sweet potato. Peel the roasted garlic so you are left with just the lovely soft centre.

⋅⋅* In a food processor or blender, add the roasted carrot, peppers, onion and garlic, the toasted spices, the coconut and almond, the tin of coconut and chopped tomato and blend until smooth. Chop the fresh coriander, you can use the stalks also just ensure to chop them finely.

⋅⋅* In the same pan you toasted the spices in, heat ½ tbsp of oil over high heat, add the drained and rinsed chickpeas and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the fresh coriander, mix well. Now add the sauce, it is a thick creamy sauce but will get looser as it heats. Simmer for 3-5 minutes. Now add the cauliflower and sweet potato and simmer for a further 3-5 minutes until heated through and all the flavours come together. Taste and add salt or tamari if needed before serving.

⋅⋅* Serve with brown basmati rice and some fresh coriander. Bon appetit!
